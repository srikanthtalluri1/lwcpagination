Add Stage-Status Tree Filter for Waiver Records

Description:
Implement a tree-style filter for the Waiver list view allowing users to filter records based on combined Stage and Status values. For example, “Draft → Pending” and “Approved → Complete.” The filter should dynamically display hierarchical options (Stage as parent, Status as child) to improve data exploration and usability.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can view Stage and Status in a tree-structured filter.

Selecting a parent (Stage) expands related Status options.

Records refresh based on selected Stage/Status combination.

Filter supports multiple selections and resets correctly.
