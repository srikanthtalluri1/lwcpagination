Button Visibility

Show the New button on Decisions list view only for users with FTE role/permission set.

Duplicate Validation

On Save, check for an existing record with the same Name and Decision Reason.

If duplicate exists → show error message: “Decision already exists.”

If no duplicate exists → save successfully and redirect to the new record’s detail page.
