Add two read-only LWCs to the TechnologyDecision__c record page:

Approval tab → list related Decision_Approval__c records.

Acknowledgement tab → list related Decision_Acknowledgement__c records.

Each list is filtered to the current Decision, shows key columns (including Actual Approver / Actual Acknowledger), supports sort/pagination, and respects sharing + CRUD/FLS.

Acceptance Criteria

Tabs render
Given a Decision record page
When I view it
Then I see Approval and Acknowledgement tabs with components.

Approvals scope
Given I open Approval
When data loads
Then I see approvals for that Decision only, with columns: Date, Stage, Assigned To, Actual Approver, Comment.

Acknowledgements scope
Given I open Acknowledgement
When data loads
Then I see acknowledgements for that Decision only, with columns: Date, Stage, Assigned To, Actual Acknowledger, Comment.

Security enforced
Given user permissions
When a user lacks record/object/field access
Then they cannot see the data or restricted fields (Apex runs with sharing + enforces CRUD/FLS).
