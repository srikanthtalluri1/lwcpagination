Parent to Child Event communication in LWC
we are passing the details from parent to child using below two ways
Public Method
Public properties. 

we are using @api decorator to make the children properties / method publicly available to parent.

Custom event communication in Lightning Web Component (Child to Parent)
Create and Dispatch an Event
Create Event : We are using the customEvent() constructor to create an event. In constructor we are passing custom event name and detail of the event. new customEvent(eventName, props);
Dispatch Event : We are dispatching an event at with EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method.  this.dispatchEvent(new customEvent(eventName, props);
Handle an Event : There are two ways to listen to an event
Declarative via html markup : We need to add “on” prefix in the event name in Parent Component during calling of Child Component for Declaratively event listener. ParentComponent    <template>
          <c-child-component oneventName={listenerHandler}></c-child-component >
     </template>
JavaScript using addEventListener method : We can explicitly attach a listener by using the addEventListner method in the parent component like below : ChildComponent this.template.addEventListener('eventName', this.handleNotification.bind(this));

Publish Subscriber model in Lightning Web Component.
We are using an library called pubsub to achieve the communication between two components which doesn’t have a direct relation to each other. For Example when Edit button is clicked on customhighlightpanel we are publishing/registering an event which is being subscribed/listened in waiversrecordpage so that fields are in edit mode.
