Enhance the Waivers list page by adding Requesting Portfolio and Requesting Domain as filter options in the left navigation panel.
These new filters will allow users to easily narrow down waiver records based on the portfolio and domain associated with the requesting application, improving usability and data discoverability.

The implementation should be done using a custom Salesforce LWC, aligned with the existing left-side filter behavior and UI standards.

Acceptance Criteria

New Filters Availability

“Requesting Portfolio” and “Requesting Domain” filters are displayed in the Waivers left navigation panel.

Filters are consistent with existing filter layout and styling.

Filter Functionality

Selecting a value in either filter updates the Waivers list in real time.

Users can filter by:

Requesting Portfolio only

Requesting Domain only

Both Requesting Portfolio and Domain together

Data Accuracy

Only waiver records matching the selected filter values are displayed.

Clearing a filter resets the results accordingly.

Usability

Filters support multi-select (if existing filters support it).

Default state shows all records when no filters are applied.

Performance

Filtering does not cause page reloads.

No noticeable performance degradation when applying filters.

Security & Access

Filters respect Salesforce object-level and field-level security.

Users only see values and records they have access to.

Cross-Browser Compatibility

Functionality works correctly in supported browsers (Chrome, Edge).
