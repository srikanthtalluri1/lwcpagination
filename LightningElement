Description

Build a record-triggered Flow to capture and store Date/Time timestamps when Stage and/or Status changes. When a record moves from one Stage/Status to another, the Flow should populate the corresponding start/end timestamp fields for reporting and tracking.

Status change (any value)

When Status changes from one value to another, the Flow must set Status Start Timestamp for the new value = NOW() and Status End Timestamp for the prior value = NOW() (based on the configured mapping/fields).

Stage change (any value)

When Stage changes from one value to another, the Flow must set Stage Start Timestamp for the new value = NOW() and Stage End Timestamp for the prior value = NOW() (based on the configured mapping/fields).

No change = no update

If Stage and Status do not change, no timestamp fields are updated.

No overwrite rule

The Flow must not overwrite existing start/end timestamps for a value unless the record re-enters that same value (if re-entry is allowed; otherwise never overwrite).
