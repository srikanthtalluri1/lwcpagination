Role-based Filters

Contractors: show only filters relevant to Approved decisions.

FTEs: show all filters for accessible decisions.

UI/UX

Left navigation panel displays available filters as collapsible sections.

Filters should map directly to datatable columns (e.g., Status, Stage, Decision Reason, Estimated Decision Date).

Multi-select support for filter values.

Selected filters should display as active tags above the datatable with an option to clear individually or all.

Behavior

Selecting/unselecting filters should refresh the datatable results dynamically without a full page reload.

Filters should apply in combination (AND logic across filter categories, OR logic within a category).

Default state: no filters applied â†’ show all accessible decisions.

Actions disabled if the filtered result returns no records.

Performance & Errors

Apply filters client-side where possible; server fetch on large datasets (>50 rows).

Lazy load results in pages (50 rows at a time) after applying filters.

Respect CRUD/FLS/sharing when applying filters.

Show error/retry banner if filter application fails.
