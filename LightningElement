Develop a custom Lightning record page for the Decision object replicating the existing standard Decision UI. The page should include the same sections, layout, and field details — including Decision Details, Acknowledgement, Approval, and History — providing a seamless and consistent user experience.

Custom record page matches the layout and styling of the current standard Decision page.

All existing fields and sections (Details, Acknowledgement, Approval, and History) are displayed correctly.

Data shown matches the actual Decision record values.

Page performance is optimized and loads without noticeable delay.

User navigation and actions (edit, view, related lists) function as in the standard page.
