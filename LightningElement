In the Waivers search box, when searching by Name, duplicate records are sometimes displayed in the results. This issue needs to be fixed so that each record appears only once.

Additionally, remove all unnecessary console.log statements (LWC/Aura) and System.debug statements (Apex) from all Waiver-related components and classes.

When searching in the Waivers search box by Name, duplicate records should not be displayed.

Each waiver record must appear only once in the search results.

Search functionality should continue to work as expected without impacting performance.

All console.log statements are removed from Waiver-related LWC/Aura components.

All System.debug statements are removed from Waiver-related Apex classes.

Code should pass PMD validation and deployment checks.

Changes should be tested in lower environment before deployment.
