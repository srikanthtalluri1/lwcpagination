Test classes must be created for the following Apex components:

TechnologyDecision_CreateFormHelper

TechnologyDecision_DataTableHandler

TechnologyDecisionTrigger

Each test class should achieve at least 85% code coverage for its respective Apex class or trigger.

All test methods must include positive, negative, and bulk scenarios.

Test data should be self-contained and created within the test class (no dependency on org data).

All tests should run successfully in the QA/Full Sandbox without errors or failures.
